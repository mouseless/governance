# Communication

We use Discord categories, text and voice channels for communication.

## Root

Office is the only channel at the root without a category. It is a member only
private voice channel. This is where you join when you're actively working for
the collective. This channel is restricted to use Push-to-Talk.

## Public Category

Anything under this category is read/write for a Contributor and above, but
read-only for the rest.

It is allowed to open various text and voice channels under this category.

Voice channels under this category should restrict users to use Push-to-Talk.

## Meet Category

Meet category is to allow organize meetings in physical and digital worlds.

Text channels under this category;

- Can be created, updated and deleted according to the project management and
  communication needs
- Are member only, and further restriction can be made according to functional
  roles

Voice Channels under this category;

- Can be used with voice activity setting enabled in discord, but to avoid
  overlapping talks number of users should be limited
- Can be created, updated and deleted on demand
- Are member only, and further restriction can be made according to functional
  roles

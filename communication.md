# Communication

We use Matrix spaces and rooms for communication. We have our own home server at
`mouseless.org`. To join please visit
[#collective:mouseless.org](https://matrix.to/#/#collective:mouseless.org).

## Root Space (`#collective`)

At the root there are rooms to enable a public discussion and information
sharing within our collective. These rooms have video call enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - All rooms are owned and governed by `@admin:mouseless.org` where all owners
>   have access to.
> - All rooms are published using their names, e.g., `#office:mouseless.org`,
>   `#baked:mouseless.org`, so you can mention them using hashtags across rooms.

## Public Space (`#public`)

This space contains only rooms for public repositories. It is open for anyone to
join.

Rooms under this space;

- Is not allowed to have video calls enabled
- Is optional for non-active repositories

## Private Space (`#private`)

This space is for members-only, where rooms for private repositories are
available. Non-repository rooms like `#office` also exists to allow general
private discussions.

> [!TIP]
>
> Each room has its own purpose explained under their room description in
> Matrix.

Rooms under this space;

- Are members-only, and further restriction can be made
- Can be created, updated and deleted according to the project management and
  communication needs
- Is optional for non-active repositories
- Must have video calls enabled if they are for discussion (non-repository
  room).

### Administration Space (`#administration`)

This space is empty in collective's home server, but anyone joins becomes a
`Moderator` to allow to add your own administration rooms to have a private
discussion regarding your clients and/or any other administrative purpose.

## Archiving a room

You may leave any room at any time whenever you think that is obsolete.
`@admin:mouseless.org` will always have access to idle rooms for archiving
purposes. Once archived, rooms will be removed from space listing and will have
no published names.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Each channel has an import message pinned to the top containing discord
>   exports in html format
> - Archived channels wasn't imported at all
> - Some channels merged into one room
>   - `meet/digitally` -> `#random`
>   - `meet/physically` -> `#random`
>   - `meet/lounge` -> `#random`
>   - `meet/daily` -> `#office`
>   - `digitally[private]` -> `#office`
>   - `announcements` -> `#governance`
>     - message archive is in `#office` since early usage contains private
>       discussions

# Work

We manage our work using various backlogs and repositories.

## Backlog / Category

Each backlog is a prioritized list of work items to be done.

In GitHub, a backlog is represented by a single markdown file in the private
`work` repository. Backlogs appear under the `01-todo` folder per company.

In Matrix, a backlog doesn't have any correspondance.

## Repository / Text Channel

We utilize git repositories to store;

- Source code
- Documentation
- Work items
- Scripts and automation
- Website Content
- Data

Most of the work we do has a corresponding repository, unless it is related to
daily operations or routine tasks.

In Matrix, each repository is represented by a chat room.

Private repositories are under an invite only space named `üîí private`, and are
accesible only to Members and above, whereas public repositories are accessible
to anyone in the collective via the public space named `üåê public`.

Write permissions for a public repository and read / write permissions for a
private repository are given to the responsible teams only. In Matrix, anybody
can write to a room they join.

## Work Item / Pull Requests / Threads

An active work item is placed under `02-in-progress` folder of the private
`work` repository as a separate markdown file. If this work is under a
repository, it has a corresponding pull request (PR) in GitHub and a
corresponding thread in Matrix. These PRs and threads are temporary places to
discuss the active work and closed as soon as it is done.

Matrix rooms can be sorted according to their activities, which makes it easy to
access active works through the most recently rooms at the top.

## A Note on Project Management

Our project management methodology is not yet documented. Until it is done,
please take the latest works as an example and ask for help in a text channel
related to your work if you have any questions.

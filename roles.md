# Roles

Roles define the authority and accountibility of individuals within our
collective.

- **Contributor**: People with no legal binding who voluntarily contribute to
  public repositories
- **Member**: People with legal binding who work for customer projects within
  the collective
- **Owner**: Responsible for the things that are not, or cannot, delegated to
  members or contributors

## Rules to Follow

- A member is added to GitHub organization
- A member is added to private space in Matrix
- New roles can be created in a specific service (Matrix, GitHub etc.) to
  workaround restrictions of that service
- Any permission in a specific service (Matrix, GitHub etc.) is allowed to be
  given to any role by moderators of that service unless it has a direct
  conflict with this governance model

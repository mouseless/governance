# Governance

Here, you will find information about how we govern our collective.

## Roles

Everyone has one or more roles to contribute to the software we're delivering.

### Legal

- **Owner**: Makes the final decisions and handles responsibilities not covered
  by current roles
- **Partner**: People with legal binding so that they get paid for what they do
- **Contributor**: People with no legal binding but known personally within our
  network who voluntarily contribute to public repositories
- **Member**: This is the base role to for the rest of the people in our Discord
  server

Each role covers those below it; for instance, an owner is also a partner, a
partner is a contributor, etc.

A member can have only one legal role.

### Functional

- **Coders**: People who professionally write code
- **Governors**: Make contributions to the governance model
- **Lawyers**: Provide legal advice, create, and review legal contracts
- **Marketers**: Take initiative in marketing the collective and its projects

These roles serve as team names on GitHub and can be mentioned on Discord.

A member can have multiple functional roles.
